# <Horiseon Homepage>

## Description

Horiseon challenge allowed html and basic css to be implemented into a website to be learned. Fomatting is important to make sure classes, ids, and other elements are called correctly so element's styles are not overriding each other.
This was a stepping stone on how to compact and be concise calling to the same class's styles so and not have repeating code in the css file. 

## Installation

No installation required to use the website.

## Usage

Website Url: https://richard-au1.github.io/Horiseon/
Github Repository Url: https://github.com/Richard-Au1/Horiseon

Once on the website there is a header section with 3 texts on the right side.

Clicking on any of these buttons will bring the user down to the section below to define what each part of Horiseon can provide. For example, if the Online Reputation Management button is pressed then the webpage will bring the user to the section below labeled Online Reputation Management and provide a brief description on how it can improve the user's business once implemented.

The user will also see the benefits that come with using Horiseon on the right side next to the 3 main services Horiseon provides.
